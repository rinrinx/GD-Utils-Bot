### How to make the App Never Sleep?
1. Setup a [CronJob](https://console.cron-job.org) to Make the heroku app never sleep
   - First Sign-up in the above Site
   - Then Go [here](https://console.cron-job.org/jobs/create), and Follow the ScreenShot below
        
        ```
        URL:
        https://YOURAPPNAME.herokuapp.com/gdutils/check.js
        ```
        ![cronJob Basic](assets/cron1.png)
   - If you have Setup Basic HTTP Auth you should fill these too
        
        ![HTTP Auth](assets/cron2.png) 
   - Now you can save and enable the cron job, and your app never Sleeps again.

2. Use [Kaffeine](https://kaffeine.herokuapp.com/) and Just give the app name, App's With Basic HTTP Auth enabled Might not work here

### Note 

* No Need to redeploy if new changes are made to src folder, it will built and your apps will fetch the latest release

* if Docker Base image is updated then you should redeploy (Not gonna happen Soon).
